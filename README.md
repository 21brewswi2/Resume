## FAQ

* My Python or Pelican commands are not recognized in command line  
    *This issue is likely due to missing enviroment variables, see the section on fixing enviroment variables below*

* My sites pelican themes appear locally but not in github pages  
 *to fix an error of this type, make sure that you have a seperate branch for your site, rather than publishing directly from main*

* I changed the markdown files, but my site still appears the same  
 *this is typically because the site needs to be regenerated, this can be done with the command "pelican content"*
