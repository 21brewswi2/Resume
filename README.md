# Creation of a static site instructions.


## Purpose  
This guide will walk you through the basics of markdown, and how to leverage those skills to create  
a simple static site using Pelican and github pages.

## Prerequisites
To effectively follow this instruction set, it is required that the user has a basic understanding of how to use the command line.  
Additionally the user must be capable of editing a basic markdown document, and navigating the windows file explorer.  
Other steps will be explained in a list format, making the creation of a webpage simple!

## Instructions
#### Downloading Python
1. Navigate to the download page [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download the correct version for your OS
3. Check the box for add Python 3.8 to path

#### Installing Pelican
1. Open Command Line
2. Install Pelican using command ``python -m pip install pelican[markdown]``

#### Installing GitHub Desktop
1. Navigate to download page [GitHubDesktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/)
2. Create a GitHub account.
3. Install GitHubDesktop and link accounts
> One of Etter's principles is understanding the audience. For someone who is less experienced with the Command Line Interface, a tool like GitHub Desktop can be more familiar. For more advanced users Command line Git would likely make this process quicker, but for a beginner this solution works well

#### Creating the site
1. Open command line
2. Use the command ``mkdir "folderName"`` to make a folder
3. Change directory to the new folder
4. Run the command ``pelican-quickstart``
5. Answer each of the provided prompts with the information that applies, see example image

> Etter reccomends using static sites as a way to simply and easily provide our documentation to users. We can quickly set up and view our site locally, as we will see in our next section, which helps with keeping our documentation up to date.

#### Adding content 
1. Navigate to the folder that you created
2. Open the folder titled content
3. Create a new markdown formatted file with desired content
4. Add Header tag ``Title: Your words Here`` Title for webpage
5. Add Header tag ``Date: 2010-12-03 10:20`` Current date
6. Add Header tag ``Category: Review`` Type of page this is

7. Remake your new content by running ``pelican content`` in command line
8. Test the new content with ``pelican --listen``
9. Navigate to [localHost:8000](http://localhost:8000/) to view new generation  

> Quick and easy updating and content addition like this is one of Etter's key principles to good technical writing. Being able to quickly make and create new up to date information, through the use of lightweight markup languages like markdown is key to success. 

#### Create a git repository
It is my reccomendation that a new user make their repository using GitHub desktop, to simplify this process. Here's how:  

1. Press file in the top left of GitHub desktop
2. Create a new repository
3. Copy the contents of folder Output that was created by pelican to the repository folder
4. Commit changes to branch main
5. Push changes to main
6. Create a branch of your repository called pages by clicking the Current branch menu
7. Empty the folder holding your repository
8. Copy the entire folder with all the files generated by pelican into the repository
9. Switch to branch main
10. Commit and push your changes

> Git serves as a version control system, following Etters recommendation of using version control to maintain accurate documentation to accompany software. This is also recommended due to developers prefernence for Distributed Version Control. In this basic use case, git is also what is allowing us to push our generated pages to the forge GitHub allowing for easy access.

#### Ensuring site is working

1. Open a web browser
2. Navigate to your GitHub account
3. Open the page for your new repository
4. Go to settings in the top middle of the screen
5. Find the pages page on the left side of the screen
6. Select deploy from a branch
7. Select pages as your branch to be deployed from
8. Visit your now public site, and verify that everything is correct

## FAQ

* My Python or Pelican commands are not recognized in command line  
    *This issue is likely due to missing enviroment variables, see the section on fixing enviroment variables below*

* My sites pelican themes appear locally but not in github pages  
 *to fix an error of this type, make sure that you have a seperate branch for your site, rather than publishing directly from main*

* I changed the markdown files, but my site still appears the same  
 *this is typically because the site needs to be regenerated, this can be done with the command "pelican content"*
