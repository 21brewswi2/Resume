<h2>Chapter 1 Basics:</h2>
<h3><em>Common misconceptions cleared up:</em></h3>
<h4>Tech writers produce <em>formal</em> documentation</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>FORMAL: not stuffy or repetitive, "induces skimming"</li>
<li>Writing SHOULD NOT call attention to itself by being too formal or casual (can adapt to audience, like if chill coders lmao)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h4>Tech writers produce <em>comprehensive</em> documentation</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>COMPREHENSIVE: minimum possible length</li>
<li>huge blocks of writing look intimidating, excessive content waters down useful content. Include only what the audience needs to know</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h4>Tech writers DO NOT help protect companies from lawsuits</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Collage legalse into their website AT MOST </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h4>Tech writers DO NOT ALWAYS produce PRINT documentation</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>minimalist "Getting Started" guide that directs people to a www web-page</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3><em>Don't Write</em></h3>
<h4>Tech writers are testers and researchers</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>your job to know what people want, communicating knowledge is the last step of the process (&gt;10% of your time)</li>
<li>engage yourself in the writing process</li>
<li>performing testing is really just for increasing personal knowledge (don't have to test any further to de-bug)</li>
<li><strong>Goal</strong>: be mentally equipped to ask intelligent questions to anyone within the scope of the tech -&gt; talk!</li>
<li>This is your research. After this, you have to tediously verify it, then you can move on.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3>Define the Audience</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Don't need to do hand-holding here, if your audience needs it they're beyond help. Assume your audience has the pre-reqs to use this tech.</li>
<li>DO NOT GET STUCK IN THE QUAGMIRE OF TRYING TO HELP THE HELPLESS</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h4><em>Users</em> are people who want to achieve something with an application</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Concerned with input and output</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h4><em>Administrators</em> install and configure applications</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>e.g. w.r.t the app: Where are the logs? How much disk space? How to recover data? How to backup?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h4><em>Developers</em> extend applications or interfaces with code.</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improve aspects of existing app or build something new</li>
<li>NEED references materials, short tutorials, code samples</li>
<li>Prioritize this, but if needed conceptual intros can be useful</li>
<li>Most <strong>designers</strong> are part of this grou</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3>Basic Functional Documentation (B F''n D)</h3>
<p><em>At a minimum, the following questions should be answered by the product documentation:</em></p>
<h4>What is this product and why would anyone want it?</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If you can't answer this question, go back to research phase, as you must understand the audience</li>
<li>Honest, buzzword-free appraisal of capabilities and use cases</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h4>How does this product fit into a broader ecosystem, it at all? Does it have any dependencies?</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Answer can be single sentence, architecture diagram, or complex discussion.</li>
<li>e.g. Web Frameworks being pared with complimentary products; developers must know which ones prior to installation</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h4>When can I achoir this product? Which of the possible many distribution packages should I choose and why?</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Self xplantorie</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h4>How do I install the product? What are the basic configuration options?</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Consumer applications should barely need this</li>
<li>Server apps REALLY need this, often longest part</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h4>What does a simple, start to finish operation look like?</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Take user from nothing to something</li>
<li>Convince readers that they've learned something</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h5>BONUS: DON'T WRITE FROM MEMORY. Always verify content, even code/shell commands</h5>
<h3>Style</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>CONSISTENCTY IS KING.</em> Don't call something a dialogue in one document and a pop-up in another, for example.</li>
<li>Bias towards including headers, tables, lists, diagrams, and images. Makes writing more approachable and easier to scan</li>
<li>Use inline styles to offset important text</li>
<li>Typically using <strong>bold</strong> for user interface elements and <em>italics</em> for emphasis</li>
<li>Don't verbify obscure nouns: "Grep it" vs "You can use grep to search the file"</li>
<li>Copy edit, but don't obsess</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3>Catalogue the Diff</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>An import aspect of tech writing is to record changes to a product</li>
<li>Good change logs can inspire confidence in a product and people to to upgrade</li>
<li>What's new/different/removed? How to upgrade? Any "gotchas"?</li>
<li>New simple features =&gt; just noting they exist is fine</li>
<li>Terse, minimalist, and scannable</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3>Build a Website</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>simple as</li>
<li>hosting content on a website gives you the power to fix inaccuracies and sync content with latest version of software, INSTANTLY</li>
<li>Distributing PDFs does not allow for this</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3>Help Others Write</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Writing and distribution should encourage others to contribute!</li>
<li>Even a large team of writers can't know everything worth knowing about an app</li>
<li>Open source, mod scene, obscure wikis, prove people will share expertise and passion if it's easy and hospitable for them to do so =&gt; PEOPLE WILL CONTRIBUTE IF YOU LET THEM</li>
<li>Ultimately your job to ensure quality of documentation</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3>Publish Frequently</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Not a special, challenging event, just quick sanity check and glance build log. Simple and functional</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2>Chapter 2: Specifics</h2>
<p><strong>How do tech writers tech write?</strong></p>
<h3>Use Lightweight Markup</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Human readable</li>
<li>Not overly dense with computer syntax</li>
<li>Free and easy to use/create with any free/open-source text editor</li>
<li>MICROSOFT WORD IS NO GOOD - same issue with PDFs as mentioned before</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3>Use Distributed Version Control</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Better performance</li>
<li>Allow for offline work</li>
<li>superior for concurrent work on same file (COMP 3350)</li>
<li>Use <em><em>MODERN</em></em> tools, like GitHub(Enterprise, Desktop) and SourceTree</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Documentation and code branches stay in sync</li>
<li>Developers are more likely to contribute if they don't have to clone a separate repo</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Large repository (&gt;= 2GB) can dramatically slow down documentation builds</li>
<li>Documentation changes can become bogged down with commit hooks, pull requests, and submission policies that are designed for stable code bases</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h4>README of the repository root</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>quick product summary</li>
<li>instructions on how to build the documentation locally</li>
<li>instructions on how to contribute</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3>Don't Duplicate</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Use (links)[] to get the holy grail of tech writing, <em>single sourcing</em></li>
<li>Core Idea: break writing into bite-sized pieces, called <strong>topics</strong></li>
<li>A <strong>topic does NOT overlap in content with another</strong></li>
<li>This means you only have to update one thing when things change, and things will change.</li>
<li>Keep topics short and complete in their discussion</li>
<li>Assume very litle knowledge of previous topics (unlike books with chapters) and include links to other topics if needed</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h4>Version Control and Duplication</h4>
<p>DO <strong>NOT</strong> STORE ALL SIMILAR COPIES OF DOCUMENTATION IN VERSION CONTROL. It's not going to help if you have a heap of different manuals and make users sift through them to find the one for them.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A solution - <em>Conditional Text</em>: selectively include/exclude portions of the file depending on cases. Can be hacky and not supported in markdown. Do not rely on it entirely</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3>Make Static Websites</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>simple as</li>
<li>Intuitive reason for using these based off of all the discussion in this book and class lectures</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3>Rsync</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Tool: Transfers only files that need to be added or updated, delete stale files.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3>Metrics</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Use Google Analytics and track the static site</li>
<li>Serve as a check against your thoughts and intuition: if your docs aren't popular maybe you're doing something wrong, maybe users will report errors</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3>Script Your Complexity Away</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If you're actually making a PDF, you need a publishing pipeline. Don't do all this yourself, use modern technology. Can even build it both as a PDF and HTML for a static site!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Legal Problem</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>"In short, assholes ruin everything": Patent trolls using your docs as evidence for copywronging</li>
<li>May have to hide docs behind customer login for one of these reasons</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3>Localization</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Translating other documentation into other languages = NIGHTMARE</li>
<li>Perform cost benefit analysis, then triple it L O L </li>
<li>Update doc, send it to translation company, THEN WAIT, build, and publish</li>
<li>This delays releases in other regions</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3>Contrived Workflow</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>example of irl scenario, page 33 if you're interested</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3>What About Wikis</h3>
<p><em>Have a place in tech writing but think carefully before selecting one</em></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Users don't need to install any apps, clone repos, learn workflows, to contribute</li>
<li>Users can spot issues and fix them very quickly</li>
<li>Every wiki has out of the box search (as opposed to static site)</li>
<li>Great for living docs that grow over time, don't need to be marked as belonging to a particular software version</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Wikis are web apps, require hosting and maintenance over time (can crash and/or slow down - needs scaling). As a tech writer, you don't care about managing websites</li>
<li>Writing on a wiki sucks, mangled html tags with lightweight markup, as you're literally writing on the wiki app, which means if your connection is disrupted you could lose your work during writing/editing</li>
<li>Version control with "blame" for problematic content doesn't exist, it's really just last person to edit has ownership (wikipedia has edit history to discourage destruction/vandalism)</li>
<li>Not local</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2>Chapter 3: The Grand Finale</h2>

<li>Consider everything a draft and iterate relentlessly</li>
<li>Make contributuon simple</li>
</ol>                    </article>
